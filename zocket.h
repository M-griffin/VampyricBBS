// ZOCKETS II -- ZBS 18 March 98
//
// Zocket is a portable wrapper around the Berkley socket layer.
// The purpose of this abstraction class is several-fold.
//  * Provide a completely portable API.  All OS specific features
//    are encoded inside of the class.
//  * Eliminate the need to include windows.h in WIN32 apps that
//    use networking
//  * Allow easy overriding of blocking / non-blocking in the
//    as parameters into read and write
//    non-blocking.
//  * Use strings for addressing to allow easy backward-compatibility
//    as new protocols are added.
//  * Allow for a non-socket level loopback.  Allows you to use the
//    networking layer even if sinsock isn't installed on a WIN32 machine.
//
// Zockets are stream based.  The inherited class "Zacket" adds a
// message aware protocol.

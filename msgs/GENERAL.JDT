If it dosent receive the modulated beeps and noises it just keeps ringing.Modem actually stands for MODulate/DEModulate..  Basically since everything your computer does is in the digital realm, it needs to convert the data that your trying to send to another modem from digital data to analog data so it can go across the phone lines.  If it wasn't modulated and demodulated, then lines wouldnt know what to do with the signal becuase there analog, not digital..modulation is the mixing of two or more frequencies, usually called the carrier and the data frequencies.. One rides on another but there at different values of hz.  thats what i remember.. im an electrical engineer so this stuff just kinda flows outta me :)|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Mercyful FateMF> hmm could always make a brand spanking new tetris game .. hehe other thMF> that i'm not to sure what kinda game i'd make.. |08. ..|15e|07nd of quoting.How about a dos based tetrinet, with multiplayer capabilities|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15DarkwingDa> . ..quoting . ..EvilrabbiEv> heh... i dont see any of us calling russia anytime soon =\... i'd prollEv> check it out if it wouldn't cost me a shit load and i could speak russiDa> . ..end of quoting.Da> Da>     So did all the internet dialouts go away?

Valve has just release a stament in there forums that the source code was indeed leaeked after they suffered a break in their security...  the following was posted in their forums...----------- start of quote...Ever have one of those weeks? This has just not been the best couple of days for me or for Valve.Yes, the source code that has been posted is the HL-2 source code.Here is what we know:1) Starting around 9/11 of this year, someone other than me was accessing my eail account. This has been determined by looking at traffic on our email server versus my travel schedule.2) Shortly afterwards my machine started acting weird (right-clicking on executables would crash explorer). I was unable to find a virus or trojan on my machine, I reformatted my hard drive, and reinstalled.3) For the next week, there appears to have been suspicious activity on my webmail account.4) Around 9/19 someone made a copy of the HL-2 source tree.5) At some point, keystroke recorders got installed on several machines at Valve. Our speculation is that these were done via a buffer overflow in Outlook's preview pane. This recorder is apparently a customized version of RemoteAnywhere created to infect Valve (at least it hasn't been seen anywhere else, and isn't detected by normal virus scanning tools).6) Periodically for the last year we've been the subject of a variety of denial of service attacks targetted at our webservers and at Steam. We don't know if these are related or independent.Well, this sucks.What I'd appreciate is the assistance of the community in tracking this down. I have a special email address for people to send information to, helpvalve@vavesoftware.com. If you have information about the denial of service attacks or the infiltration of our network, please send the details. There are some pretty obvious places to start with the posts and records in IRC, so if you can point us in the right direction, that would be great.We at Valve have always thought of ourselves as being part of a community, and I can't imagine a better group of people to help us take care of these problems than this community.---------------------- end quotea part of me feel sorry for the guy for loosing the source.. as another part of me is like this is cool casue i love to check out source code...But it also shows a huge problem with MS OutLook and that even now it's not very secure...   what do you guys think?I was watching the disovery channel.. and a nice little show called myth busters..  They wanted to test the myth that has been making rounds that CD Rom disks have been shattering in the cd roms drive...  it was a pretty cool experiment.. first they took some 52x cd roms drives and tested the drive.. but one thing they found was that the 52x was only spiing at about 1/2 of the spped.. aprox 20,000 rpm instead of 52,000 rps..  possibly due to the hardhard they had where the system couldn't read the disk going that fast..  eventually they got some hardward that was tested t go about 60,000 rpm and proceeded to do their tested..  they setup everything in a controled space.. incase the cd did shatter.. cd fragments spinning at that man rpm would probably rip a person to pieces..  so they made a type of silicon dummy the share of a person and put them right next to the cd-rom while they tested..  and what they found what at prox 52-60 rpm.. the cd's can't take that many rpm and actually do shatter!  in an open tray with the cd shattering.. piece were stuck in the silicon dummy up to 3 inch's deep in it's skin.. ouch!..  and while inside the case.. it look like the cdrom drive it self was hit by fricking hammer from the inside..  pretty crazy stuff.. but very cool that someone tested it all out!.. so watch out with your 52x cd rom drive's.. you could just shatter your cd's if it's running at full speed!  and even close to that speed the cd's start to warp as well..|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Mercyful FateMF> yeah totally.. before i'll even try a new ms OS.. i'll usualyl wait tilMF> first service pack is out or so.. i can even count how many times the fMF> releases of each of MS OS's just run like crap..  it was the same for 9MF> 98, 2k, xp.. etc..  haha what a great track record they've got!MF> MF> were lucky we don't have thier shit in our hospitals and cars.. haha|08. ..|15e|07nd of quoting.hahaha yah I hear that, their release candidates seem to work better than the actual releases =) actually its scary how many things we depend on run their products, ever see those big monitors or atms bluescreen?! heheh luckily those are critical .|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Lord NothingLN> i would give anything to see dimmu live.. and any number of other blackLN> bands.. but, bein' in BFE, TN, that will never fuckin' happen.. damnit!|08. ..|15e|07nd of quoting.as well you should, they put on a great show =)|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Mercyful FateMF> sloth to the latest and greatest version of NTP!!  heh..

After a connect is detected .. you call accept with another socket.. like so..newsocket = accept(listensocket,...,...); so listen socket is bound to listen on on the port.. once it connects you forward to the newsocket, then the newsocket become the connect, the loop then resets back to listen.. where it will listen for another conenction on the listensocket again...|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15ParanoidPa> american beer is like having sex in a canoePa> fucking close to water :)|08. ..|15e|07nd of quoting.haha yes, but it's a special water and makes you feel weeeeeeee! :)|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15DarkwingDa>     I'm trying some Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blonde right now...

quoting.well i do agree and i do disagree, it all depends on who is administrating the machine, i use a firewall that isnt very popular, i made my own mini programs for it for my own remote admin purposes, i have non standard connection sequences and do certain things to open up my firewall, my system is pretty damn secure for the most part..internal remote administration options are good for a operating system, terminal services server runs close to kernel level and is actually the best remote administration you can ever get!, and there ARE ways to make it crypted between two connections so thats is a added bonus (dont ask, i dont rem how hehe)if you have ever done remote administration on a windows machine you will notice that remotedesktop/terminal services is WAY faster then VNC in windows or any other remote admin program (especially the norton product, that includes the enterprise edition of it too!)i agree that it just opens up problems, but its all up to the user, and remote desktop is NOT enabled by default, (well not usually), and you HAVE to have a password set or else it wont let you remote administrate the machine, also the user has to exist in the remote desktop users group, etc, etc etc, so there is some sort of security there :)nothing is 100% safe from virus/trojan or exploit infections, and really if you think about it you could easily write a remote admin program and have it load easily to someones machine via internet explorer if he/she visits a website :) (really its rather simple to do, look at any crack site that loads stupid crap onto your machine, a good example is GOGATOR or comet cursor, those exploit a installer function)|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Mercyful FateMF> . ..quoting . ..ParanoidPa>

deployment, but shouldnt be accessible to any host that is not a trusted host, since hte RPC protocol is actually really simple to use, theres a bunch of visual basic script code that does remote functions on windows RPC enabled machines that have that port accessible, with it there are possibilities to test/probe password sam pasword hashes (brute force, dictionary, etc)well, even linux has a RPC port :), and im sure its insecure too :) [given time anything can be broken, especially by idiot user]|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15Mercyful FateMF> So has anyone caught any good

linux door32 door before have ya?  hehe  but i'm sure if g00r00 made his own telnet server, then it would probably be alot easier to forward the socket handle over through the bbs as well.. and have access to it.. although in linux you don't need the socket handle.. if you detect linux then you just need to call normal STDIN / OUT which is alot more easier then sockets.. but i know you point, you want the IP address for easy access, hmm which might just be avialable in the next version if you think about since g00r00 addedd the IP address forwaring for NTP and external protocols.. might want to ask em next time you catch him on irc... ;)|08. ..|15q|07uoting |08. ..|15IcedevilIc> haha oh yah definately had those, funny that we're having this convo thIc> other night when

Lucky for me it was the wifes fault that the dog got out and not mine....Shit I can just imagine the bitchfest that would be going on!!!! Of course I get stuck with the grave diggers job, lucky for me he was a jackrussel!  The hole wasnt quite big enough so his head did quite fit, so I just stepped on him a bit and that did the trick!  The funny part was, the wife saying "Don't setp on him!" I said "He's already dead! What are you worried about? I might bruse him?"  HA!  Well lucky for me I can keep the humor in death! Just makes it that much easier to get over it.  Too bad he was a very friendly dog, but his problem was, he like to run, this time in traffic.

I was like " what ? what do you mean... this is how we punish idiots in the army... we smoke them till they colapse " and he was like " well... just make sure you give him some water .. . hehe differant strokes for differant folks.personally if your my soldier and you fuck up...
